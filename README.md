State vs Redux

Simple demonstration React app modeling the difference between using this.setState to render and change the color of a React button component vs. using Redux to render the same button component and change the color.

Go to the 'source-code' branch and download the zip.

Paste contents of the zip 'state-vs-redux-source-code' into the directory you run your react apps from.

In your command window cd into your 'state-vs-redux-source-code' directory and run 'yarn install'.

Then run 'yarn start'.
